# dynamic_collections:
  ## Use DC as suffix to avoid name conflicts with static collections
  ## These get generated in the order they are listed here, so put the more intensive ones at the bottom

  # Per-Country DC Shows: # mapping name does not matter just needs to be unique
    # A bug in PMM: expects `origin_country` instead of `country` used by Movies, but Plex uses `country` for both Movies and Shows now
    # This collection will fail until PMM's validation is fixed
