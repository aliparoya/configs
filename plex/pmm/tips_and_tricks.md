## Promotion
- Use sort_title to promote and demote certain collections 
  - start with `+` to promote to top of library
  - start with `~` to demote to bottom of a library

Prefix suggestions:
```
# Prefixes for (Movie) Collections:
#   +01_ = Charts
#   +02_ = Holidays
#   +03_ = Studios or Network
#   +04_ = Genres
#   +05_ = Countries
#   +06_ = Awards
#   +07_ = Collections
#   +08_ = Decades
#   +09_ = People
#   +10_ = General
```

## Visibility
- `visible_library`, `visible_home` and `visible_shared`
  - `true`, `false` or [schedule](https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Meta-Manager/wiki/Schedule-Detail) available for all options

## Scheduling
- Save time by updating lesser-important collections and playlists less frequently:
  - ex. `schedule: weekly(wednesday), weekly(sunday)`
